                <p class = "text">Ever notice ads constantly following you around? That’s in part because Google tracks your searches and hides trackers on millions of websites. By contrast, our private search engine doesn’t track your searches and our <a href = "#">DuckDuckGo browser extension and mobile app</a> block Google’s (and many other companies’) trackers across the Internet, helping to keep your browsing history more private, as it should be. And that’s just the beginning — by using DuckDuckGo you also escape the manipulation of the filter bubble and can use the Internet faster (after all that tracking code is disabled). <a href = "#">Learn more</a>.</p>

We have everything you’ve come to expect in an online search experience, and a few <a href = "#">bonus features</a> that make searching the Internet not only private, but also a bit more fun!

                <p class = "text">It is a myth that you can’t be tracked while using so-called “Incognito” mode. In fact, Incognito mode mainly just deletes information on your computer and does nothing to stop Google from saving your searches, nor does it stop companies, Internet service providers, or governments from being able to track you across the Internet. By contrast, DuckDuckGo search is completely anonymous and if you add our app & extension on top, we help keep you private when browsing off of search results. <a href = "#">Learn more</a>.</p>
